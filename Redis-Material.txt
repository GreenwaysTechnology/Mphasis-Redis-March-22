				Redis
..............................................................................................

What is Redis?
   Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory "data structure(List,Stack,LinkedList,Set,HashTable,Map") store

What is Data Structure?
  Organization of data based on structure.

Objective :
    - Store - write - IO
    - Process - IO , CPU
    - Report -read -IO

Store:
     1.Peristent : Permanent
       -Disk store
          -Files
             -Structured
                    -Database Management System/Relational Database System
			 -SQL-----------------------Reading,Processing,Write
             -Unstructured
                    -NOSQL Movement
		    -Big Data
     2.In Memory : not permant

In Memory Data Structure
  
   Storing data inside RAM
   Read data from RAM
   Processing data from RAM.
   Storing data in cpu register.

Common Characteristics NOSQL

1.schemaless
  A schemaless database allows you to store any data

A schemaless database allows any data, structured with individual fields and structures, to be stored in the database.
Being schemaless reduces ceremony (you don't have to define schemas) and increases flexibility (you can store all sorts of data without prior definition)

The concept of "schema" also applies in-memory

Every programming language captures data in the form of "schema (plan)"

java:

class Customer {
  int id;
  String name;
  double invoiceValue;
}

Customer cust=new Customer();
cust.id =1; //storing data in memory

A class definition defines the logical fields you can use to manipulate it. This is effectively a schema.

One object can combine a schema and schemaless access.

class Customer {
  int id;
  String name;
  double invoiceValue;
}

Customer cust=new Customer();
cust.city = ""

2.Not using Relational model therory

3.Running on well on clusters 
    To enable fail over,High Avaiability

4.Open sources
.........................................................
Drawbacks of Relational DBs
- Impedance mismatch (In-memory(object) model of an application is different from (relational) model on disk). 

- That's why there are ORM frameworks which lead to loss of performance
- They are not designed to run efficiently on clusters

Why they are picking up now

- There is a movement away from using databases as integration points towards encapsulating databases within applications and integrating through (web) services.

- The vital factor for a change in data storage was the need to support large volumes of data by running on clusters.
- Relational DBs can be very costly to support large volume of data.

				NoSQL data base Types
.............................................................................................

1.Key-value Store
2.Document based Store
3.Column Based Store
4.Graph based Store


1.Key-Value Store:
 
In this model, data is stored,processed based on the concept called "Key-value"
- Key-Value
 : based on data structure called "dictionary/map/hashmap/hashtable"

 KEY ------------>Value

 id 1000 -------> Subramanian

 id 2000--------->Murgan

Implementations:

1.Redis
2.Riak
3.Memcached
4.Hazelcast
5.Apache Ignite


2.Document based Store

A document database (also known as a document-oriented database or a document store) is a database that stores information in documents.

https://www.mongodb.com/document-databases

Document:
  Collection of information;
eg:
  SGML
  XML
  HTML
  JSON -

Implementations

1.Mongodb
2.CouchDB

3.Coloumn based store
